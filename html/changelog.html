			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds new sprites for the Ironhammer Voidsuit. By Watler. Now they are regularly available in the lower armoury.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">An Ironhammer operative entering the armoury now has a total of six armour options available to them, and all of these have their advantages and drawbacks.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Rearranged things in the armoury to add three voidsuit spawns, along with magboots and jetpack for each. Removed several of the gasmasks, oxygen tanks, and portable flashers. And instead added in some double capacity emergency tanks, and an oxygen canister for refilling.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Extended Excelsior turret working range by 50%.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The voidsuit's stats are reworked a bit, and its positioned squarely inbetween the stats of a normal vest, and an IH rig suit. The rig is both better armored and faster, but the voidsuit is less demanding on your storage space.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly buffed the stats of ironhammer hardsuit, and serbian SCAF suit, based on observations of combat performance.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed the Chief Engineer's rig too, for such a vital role they have an alarmingly common habit of dying alone in maintenance.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed the handmade armor vest, because it sucks and nobody uses it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly buffed the non primary stats of the three specialist vests to keep them viable, but also added minor slowdown to bulletproof and ablative vest.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added many parts to the excelsior disk so they can actually create shield generators.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the excelsior autolathe not working properly when manually constructed.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Allowed slots on suits not allowing large weapons.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed fireaxe sprites when facing east.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed excelsior implants not being properly setup when spawned by storyteller, resulting in their own turrets shooting them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed storyteller having a defunct 'roleset' option in the roleset pool which wasted antag points.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Majorly reworked how material costs are calculated for protolathe, autolathe and circuit imprinter designs. Some costs were adjusted in the process</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made the prices of ordering materials in the guild far cheaper. Also added a bulk metal crate for large quantities of steel at once.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Major overhaul of Excelsior. Finally they have recieved the Healing Touch of Nanako.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Implants now work. In addition, we made implants generally implantable in nonhuman organic mobs. This allows excelsior to implant their pets so that turrets and shields don't target them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a couple new item recipes, disk cloner and the new Excelsior armored space suit, sprites thanks to Watler.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Excelsior Armor is balanced around the teleporter. It requires a moderate amount of plasteel, and you can manufacture a full set every 10 minutes. It's moderately powerful all around, especially vs laser weapons.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Excelsior Shieldwall now unlocks for any excelsior instead of requiring engineering access. The shield barrier itself now also selectively allows excelsior-implanted people through, while blocking the normies.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Departments themselves are also paid, each department gets an hourly budget infusion to their departmental funds, drawn from the same source as their wages.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Ship Account now starts with three million credits. It is used to pay other departments as outlined above. Captain is encouraged to roleplay with the money and not just make it rain from the catwalks.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Instead of captain, now any head of staff is required to start the round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a few more grenade types to the grenades section of the Uplink. Frags, highex, teargas, with appropriate costs.</li>
