changes:
  - rscadd: Sub-access types to ID modification. Department heads can now add or remove
      access to their departments and general ship areas.
  - tweak: re-did some of the ID computer code, and moved a few access types around.
      Maint is now a general access type, instead of an engineering one.
  - refactor: Refactored the authorization function, to allow it to check for all
      the ID mod subtypes.
