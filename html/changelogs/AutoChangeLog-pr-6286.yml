changes:
  - balance: The carrion's Maw's Consume Flesh ability now removes a random organ
      from and damages the target instead of tearing it off, can't be initiated while
      in progress, and does not work with a weak grab.
  - balance: Rotten organs are now worth only a third of the points to carrions.
  - spellcheck: Cleaned up the Maw's Consume Flesh ability text.
