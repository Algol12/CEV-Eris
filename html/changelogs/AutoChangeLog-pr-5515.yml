changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed a massive exploit that allowed you to insert a negative number of
      biomass in the biomass cloning container. Because of bad logic when inserting
      -99999 biomass inside you LITERALLY get a stack of 99999+ biomass sheets in
      your hand.
  - bugfix: Fix exploit when you insert more biomass sheets than what you currently
      have. The logic literally bypassed taking the sheets from your hand.
  - bugfix: The cloning biocanister now doesn't give you a satisfying ping as intended
      when you do not insert any biomatter sheets.
  - rscadd: the game now gives you a reality check when you insert an impossible amount
      of biomatter sheets in to the biomass container.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up terrible code in cloning.dm
