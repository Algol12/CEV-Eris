  - tweak: Performed some map changes, Genetics now has had their cameras removed
      to protect proprietary knowledge, and they've been re-used to instead act as
      cameras within Chemistry. Removed the abundance of junk piles in certain areas,
      and fixed some maintenance areas spawning exposed to space.
